# Apache-Airflow-Beam-TensorFlow-Examples
Various examples for TensorFlow Extended using Apache Beam and Airflow

## Preface

<p> In this repository the possiblities of TensorFlow Extended in combination with Apache Airflow and Apache Beam will be discovered. In order to do that, some Pipelines will be created and presented, which will run the different DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). While showing a basic example with CSV Data, especially on Computer Vision tasks will be put a focus. Therefore at least a Image Classification and Semantic Segmantation Pipeline will be presented</p>
<p>Since I only have an Windows Computer I will run everything on the Ubuntu20.04 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and will write a guide for a proper setup. Furthermore with the right setup every example and code file should be executable on any Windows (and of courde Linux) computer.</p>
